**20 points**

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to convert a Raptor flowchart to a Java program and create a dual-alternative selection structure using Raptor.

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create a dual-alternative selection structure using Raptor

## Pre-Lab

Do the following activities before doing the lab assignment. 

* Read chapter 4 (Programming Logic Design book) from pages 122 to 129
* Open the ["Programming Control Structure"](https://cerritos.instructure.com/courses/42799/files/2478040/download?wrap=1) document. Read the Selection Control from pages 2 to 5.
* View the short video below on how to create nested selection structures using Raptor. [Raptor Nested Decision Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh7pJDQJi2U)
* Do the homework assignment 5.

## Problem

A company ABC asked you to design a simple payroll program that calculates an employee's weekly gross pay, including any overtime wages. If employees work over 40 hours a week, they will get 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for all hours over 40. Your program asks the user to input hours worked for a week, regular hourly rate, and then display the weekly gross pay. Draw the Raptor flowchart to represent the logic of the problem. Name the Raptor flowchart file as lab3.rap.
