# Lab assignment 1 - Introduction to Flowchart and Pseudocode 
**Due:**  Friday, July 10  by 11:59 pm    **Point:** 20 points    

This assignment addresses the following lesson objective:

* Create a flowchart and pseudocode to represent the program's logic

This lesson objective addresses the following course learning outcomes:

3. Create a flowchart to represent the program's logic
4. Write a pseudocode to present the programâ€™s logic.

## PreLab

Do the following activities before doing the lab assignment. 

* Read chapter 1 from the Programming Logic Design book
* Do the homework assignment 1
* Install the  [Raptor Software](https://cerritos.instructure.com/courses/42799/pages/raptor-software-installation-info)
* Watch the video ["Introduction to programming with Raptor"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcAALK3movs&ab_channel=RandallBower)
* Read ["Sample example that is similar to the lab assignmentPreview the document".](https://cerritos.instructure.com/courses/42799/files/2477972/download?wrap=1)
  Download the document. Reviewing the problem and solution will help you to do the lab assignment 1.

## Problem  

Create a flowchart using Raptor and write pseudocode to represent a logic of a program that inputs from the user the height and width of a wall, calculates and displays the amount of paint you need to cover the wall. It takes one gallon of paint for every 150 square feet of wall.

Sample output:

**Enter the height (feet):**  150

**Enter the width (feet):**   10

**The amount of paint is 10 gallons.**

Note: The bold letters mean the computer generates the output. The normal letters indicate the user enters the input from the keyboard.

## Submission.

1. Upload the file lab1.rap to the Canvas.
2. Write the pseudocode in the text entry box in Canvas.

## Lab assignment Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Approx. % of Grade | Excellent (100%) | Adequate (80%) | Poor (60%) | Not Met (0%) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Program Specification / Corrections** | 50% (10 points) | No errors, program always works correctly and meets the specification(s).	| Minor details of the program specification are violated, program functions incorrectly for some inputs.	| Significant details of the specification are violated, the program often exhibits incorrect behavior.	| The program only functions correctly in very limited cases or not at all. |
| **Readability** | 20% (4 points) | No errors, code is clean, understandable, and well-organized. | Minor issues with consistent indentation, use of whitespace, variable naming, or general organization.	| At least one major issue with indentation, whitespace, variable names, or organization.	| Major problems with at three or four of the readability subcategories. |
| **Documentation** | 10% (2 points) | No errors, code is well-commented.	| One or two places that could benefit from comments are missing them or the code is overly commented. | File header missing, complicated lines or sections of code uncommented or lacking meaningful comments. | No file header or comments present. |	
| **Code Efficiency** | 15% (3 points) | No errors, code uses the best approach in every case. | No errors, code uses the working approach in every case. | Code uses poorly-chosen approaches in at least one place. | Many things in the code could have been accomplished in an easier, faster, or otherwise better fashion. | 
| **Assignment Specifications** | 5% (1 point) | No errors | N/A | Minor details of the assignment specification are violated, such as files named incorrectly or extra instructions slightly misunderstood. | Significant details of the specification are violated, such as extra instructions ignored or entirely misunderstood. |
