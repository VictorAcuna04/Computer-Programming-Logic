**Assigned date:**   Mon 8/3
**Due date:**   Sunday  8/9
**20 points**

## Objectives:

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Create a counter-control loop in Python

## PreLab

Do the following activities before doing the lab assignment. 

* Read the lecture note "Loop in Python" posted in week 10.  Use the while loop in your solution.

## Problem 

Redo lab assignment 9 using Python.

Here is the pseudocode that will provide you the logic solution.  You need to convert the pseudocode to Python.
##
#Initialize celsius to 0

c = 0

#Display the column title "Celsius" and "Fahrenheit"


#Setup a while loop with the condition celsius <= 15


#Loop body will do the following:

#Determine fahrenheit based on the formula fahrenheit = 9/5 * celsius + 32

#Display celsius and fahrenheit

#print(c, " ", "%.2f" % f) where "%.2f" % f is used to format fahrenheit to 2 decimal places

#Incremet celsius to 1.
